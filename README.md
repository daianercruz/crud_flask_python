# CRUD Application with Flask

This is a simple backend CRUD application built with Flask in Python. It provides basic API endpoints to interact with a database, allowing for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of records

## Features
- API for creating new user and post
- API for retrieving existing new user and post
- API for updating new user and post
- API for deleting new user and post
- JWT authentication for secure API access


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Flask
- SQLite
- Postman 
- Flask-SQLAlchemy (for database management)
- Flask-Migrate (for database migrations)
- Flask-JWT-Extended (for handling JWT authentication)


## This project makes use of the following Python libraries:

- **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework, designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

- **[Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)**: An extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy, the Python SQL toolkit. It simplifies database integration and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

- **[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides full flexibility for SQL database operations.

- **[Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/)**: An extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

- **[Flask-JWT-Extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/)**: An extension for Flask that adds support for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication. It provides secure access to API routes.

- **[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)**: A package for creating command-line interfaces in Python. It's used for custom Flask commands and utility scripts.

- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)**: A lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process. It's suitable for small to medium-sized applications and is easy to set up with Flask.

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management and environment setup


This project is under construction. More features and improvements are planned for future updates.
